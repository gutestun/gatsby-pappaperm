# Day 11 - Morning of non-chaos
*Monday 2021-01-18*

Blissfull morning. [Fury-Girl](Fury-Girl.md) put her name to shame and spent the whole morning making [The-Baby-Son](The-Baby-Son.md) laugh. Feeding went well, no tantrums because a slice of cheese stuck slightly outside the edge of the bread, no throwing of clothes, no glass-shattering, banshee-screams.

Just a caring big sister who even – on her own accord – initiated a garbage-bag-picking-up sequence. It faled to iterate through all the steps and end up in the actual putting of the garbage bag into the garbage bin, but the intention was there.

**I** even did not break into profuse sweating when [[The Dreaded Time of Departure]] was upon us.
