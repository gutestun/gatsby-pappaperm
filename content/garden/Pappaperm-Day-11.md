# Day 11 - Morning of non-chaos and return to adulthood
*Monday 2021-01-18*

Blissfull morning. [[Fury-Girl]] put her name to shame and spent the whole morning making [[The-Baby-Son]] laugh. Feeding went well, no tantrums because a slice of cheese stuck slightly outside the edge of the bread, no throwing of clothes across the hallway because a‚Ä¶ To be honest, I still haven't quite figured out what the F-ING problem with the clothes are yet‚Ä¶ Anyway, No glass-shattering, banshee-screams. Success!

There was just a caring big sister who even ‚Äì on her own accord ‚Äì initiated a garbage-bag-picking-up sequence. It failed to iterate through all the steps and end up with the actual putting of the garbage bag into the garbage bin, but there was Good Intention.

That, I have learned, is the most one should expect of a five year-old.

When [[The-Dreaded-Time-of-Departure]] was upon us I did not even break into a sweat (or panic, or despair)! The small one slept for a record-breaking two whole hours, meaning I could take a shower! I put product in my hair, deodorant under my arms. Brushed my teeth properly. I was again, a [[Normally-Functioning-Human-Unit]].

Not that I actually *met* anybody, or that those I walked past seemed to care, but it made me feel ok-er.

That, I have learned, is the most one should expect as a forty-year old.
