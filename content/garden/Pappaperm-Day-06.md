# Day 06
## (is this the) Real life; The Sixth Day
This morning I found myself first giving orders to a cardboard robot.  

By this time, 07:30, I had been up for 2.5 hrs. The robot had been up for 3.5 with [[The Woman]]. 

Then, shortly after, I was being surrounded by Batman, who threw a [[tantrum]] because his mask was broken (it wasn't he fixed it himself, but not to his satisfaction, I think, I don't know, it looked perfectly fine to me). The mask was thrown onto the floor where it was picked up by [[The Baby-Son]], who threw a tantrum when I replaced the mask with a yellow plastic mug. Shorly thereafter I had said baby on my belly in a harness while Batman sulked in his room.

My [[coffee]] this morning was made doubleplus strong.

# Weekend recap
*The weekend is technically not part of the pappaperm, but weekends have the potential for just as many shenanigans and adventures as the weekdays. At least for single, childlessers. I just sum up two arbitrary days of the "week" that are quite like the other five days of the "week". Nothing has meaning any more.*

Except for:

## [[Mummitrollet]]
Snusmumrikken and Lille My are siblings! During my 5-year old's viewing of Mummitrollet I finally acted upon a curiosity that has percolated for a while; What's the origin story of hattifnattene?

I didn't find out a lot more than one of the episodes told us, but I clicked around and found that juicy bit of gossip. Nothing like a juicy piece of Mummitroll-gossip, of which there is more to come, after we get into the character I identify with the most.

I would have liked it to be Snusmumrikken, with his care-free attitude and independent, nomadic lifestyle (I could forego the constant camping though), but it's not him, it's Mummipappa!

## Mummipappa
His back story has been on my mind **a lot** lately. Partly because my regular morning coffee-mug is a Mummipappa-mug and I am reminded of him every day whether I want to or not. But I've taken to use that cup more and more after I half-watched two episodes; 

one in which he follows the Hattifnatter in a boat, and another one in which he gets so down because he feels like a bad role model to his son and takes up… working! Leaves the home every day, briefcase in hand, open, usually, with stuff falling out of it.

He seems very sympathetic, and apparently has an interesting past; raised in an orphanage that he escaped from, was best friends with Snusmumrikkens dad whom he went on various adventures with. 

Finally, on my mug, he is depicted with a telescope, watching the stars. For my 40th birthday I got a telescope, with which to watch the stars…

## The Gossip
Gossip No. 2: A suspicion confirmed: Hufsa and Tufsa are gay. When Sniff is on MDMA.. I mean, when Trollmannen bestows upon him the curse-gift(1) of empathy he tells them they should not hide their love, their gender is ambiguous, they hold hands a lot. Also, Tove Janson had girlfriends.

1) Much like what children are, really.
