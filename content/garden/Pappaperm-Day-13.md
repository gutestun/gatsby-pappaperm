# Day 13 â€“ The Sound and Weight of Silence

Today I leave you with only a quote from a friend.

We were walking the little ones, and mine was silent. Happy. Content. Pretty weird and abnormal for a baby, so yes, we are worried.

Anyway, her comment:

>Sound: 0.5 baby
>Weight: 1.5 babies
>On average you have one baby.
