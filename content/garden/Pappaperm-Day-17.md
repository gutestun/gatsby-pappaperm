# Day 17

Installing those things that secure the cupboards. So baby does not accidentally discover and ingest the household chemicals we use for production of me… for cleaning purposes. Installing was a breeze last time. Last time there were no instructions. I did it on my own. No biggie. I'm handy enough.

This time, though, this time there *were* instructions!

And a guide. Good riddance! Measure twice, cut once, they say. Eyeball ten times, cut once, then either make it fit despite being askew, or exclaim expletitives and do it again, with a slightly improved result, then sigh heavily – half of satisfaction of a job half-well done, half out of resignation – and grab a beer to celebrate/drown your self-loathing, I say.

As you might surmise, my relationship to instructions is… complicated. 

So, what happened was that the paper-sticker-thing that was provided to show me where to drill the second pair of holes was… well, it had a use unit of exactly *one* less. That means useless, if you use metric or imperial units of measurment.

True to my credo of *never* measuring twice and *always* cutting slightly too much, the installation nevertheless seemed ok. To check – curtains open, swelling music, palpable anticipation in the audience – I close the door, hear a click, and like the slot machine sound when all the rollers match up, my brain's dopamine circuits went DING-DING-DING!

Now for the celebratory quality assurance

I pull the door, and it stops, as it should. Good. Another dopamine-DING! But… I can't actually see the bit of the thingy that I am supposed to push down when I want to open the cabinet of cleaning liquids. The counter, I now realize, has a lip that protrudes *just* enough that there is no way to get to the security-thingy. My finger won't fint, neither the index nor the pinky. Neither that of The Woman, nor child 1 and – how ironic that would be if it did – neither that of the baby.

My one hope is a really slim aluminium ruler that I have, but I dare not fetch it in fear of it being too thick, and all the precious cleaning chemicals being locked in forever.

Maybe next week, maybe then I'll have gathered enough courage.
