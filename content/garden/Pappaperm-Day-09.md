I thought about USB cables as I was about to insert the USB cable. What I thought was that "haha you never get it right until the third try" thing, where the first time you tried it was the right way around but you didn't get it in, so you turn it… yeah, you get it.  

I did that while thinking about it.  

Made me chuckle.  

That was my day.  

That's it.

Addendum: Is this pappaperm-"blog" thing actually a good idea? Doing **any**thing *every* day is ***always*** a chore…
