## Day 03
On day three I feel the need!  
  
The deep, deep need to feel!  
  
To feel like adults feel!  

Proper adults. Adults who commune with adults. Wonder what that was like.

And this is but **Tird Day of The Leave**. Goodness help me…

Anyway; I ditch the outdoorwear Norwegians put on for all and any occasions and pull on *grey* jeans and a *grey* woolen coat (because this is still Norway, and if we don't wear bright (but preferably **black**) outdoorwear we wear *no colours* at all.)
 
So; now I am with proper adult clothes (sans tie and shoes that need polishing – I am no square).

**It paid off**: A taxi driver whom I let go before me smiled to me in thanks in such a way that it suggested genuine human, positive emotion had been felt by said driver of the taxi I let go before me. The smile sure had a lot of teeth. The more teeth, the more glory in the smile.

Took some time to process and savour.

I had done A Good Deed(tm).

I think.

When compute finish reciprocal smile happen.

It was only 10 in the morning and my day had already been made! This year and paternity leave is off to a magnificient start! Nothing can go wrong!! I can conquer worlds!!!

By dinner I shall have summoned Dschinghis Khan and Captain Kirk and they will have laid waste to Europe by supper. I – burning torch in hand – will wonder if sleep deprivation is as bad as they say it is, or just puts some spice into your imagination.
