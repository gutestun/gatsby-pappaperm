## Day 03
On day three I feel the need!  
  
The deep, deep need to feel!  
  
To feel like adults feel!  

Proper adults. Real adults. Adults who commune with other adults of equal degree of properness and realness. Wonder what that was like.

And this is but **Tird Day of The Leave**. Goodness help me…

Anyway; I ditch the outdoorwear Norwegians put on for all and any occasions and pull on *grey* jeans and a *grey* woolen coat (because this is still Norway, and if we don't wear bright (but preferably **black**) outdoorwear we wear *no colours* at all, and we consider black a colour, but accept it, begrudgingly)
 
So; now I am with proper adult clothes.

Experienced accomplishment level: 10.  
Objective accomplishment level: Uncertain, the real world is slipping away…
