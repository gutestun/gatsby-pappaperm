Every. Single. Time.

## Insanity has set in
It takes approximately three days before you begin an incessant verbal stream of inconsequential observations about your steadily shrinking world. This is directed at the baby.  
  
Mostly.  

On the fourth day – the today-day – you talk to the coffee machine. And the air; you let words float into thin air to see if it responds.  

It does not. (might have to wait until day 16, maybe?)

## Diaper change
Changing diapers. Baby on belly. I message The Woman about something *extremely* important (*every time I pick up my phone it is important*). 

During this time baby relaxes. Consequently bladder pressure decreases significalty → fluid displacement: From inside baby → outside baby → *on* to front side of baby (belly) *and* the mat upon which baby rested. A film of fresh baby-bee between the baby and the changing mat is now ready for Paternal Unit to remove with a damp (warm – baby likes it very warm) cloth. Parental Joy is administered by way of oxytocin release in synaptic gap + qualia of disgust induced by Human Larvae piss = cognitive dissonance.

## Capitalism (Buying stuff) is fun
Going mad looking for another stroller/trolley/wagon/thing the baby lies and sits in and observes the world while I develop strong calves and tired thighs pushing the little philosopher-observer-king.

I hate finn.no. Were I to calculate time spent researching things (both things I end up buying and not buyign) I would probably discover I could have ran a side-business with enough revenue to buy everything I bought on Finn at full price. Money is time, Time is money.
