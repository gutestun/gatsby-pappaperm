# Day 04
- **Me**: Increase in talk to baby: Marked.  
	- **Analysis**: Lack of social contact with adults.  
	- **Consequence**: Babbling incessantly to wife when she gets home from work  
- **Baby**: hole in kitchen floor: inspected.  
Again.  
First item on agenda upon crawling into kitchen.  
Every. Single. Time.
- **Baby**: New discovery: aluminium ruler.
- **Together**: Introduced baby to some music
	- Los Plantronics - trash surf twang
	- Psytrance

## Insanity has set in
It takes approximately three days before you begin an incessant verbal stream of inconsequential observations about your steadily shrinking world. This is directed at the baby.  
  
Mostly.  

On the fourth day – the today-day – you talk to the coffee machine. And the air; you let words float into thin air to see if it responds.  

It does not. (might have to wait until day 16, maybe? When psychosis has had time to fully form)

## Diaper change
Changing diapers. Baby on belly. I message The Woman about something *extremely* important (*every time I pick up my phone it is important*). 

During this time baby relaxes...

Consequently: Bladder pressure decreases significalty → fluid displacement from inside of baby to outside of baby → *on* to front side of baby (belly) *and* the mat upon which belly, baby, is resting.

A film of fresh baby-bee between the baby and the changing mat is now ready for Paternal Unit to remove with a damp (warm – baby likes it very warm) cloth.

Parental Joy is administered by way of oxytocin release in synaptic gap + qualia of disgust induced by Human Larvae piss = cognitive dissonance.

Paternalhood is a complicated, convoluted process.
