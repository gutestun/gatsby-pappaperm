# Day 07
*2021-01-14 (technically written on day 09, not 07)*

Something slightly funny happened on this day. I thought about writing it, down, but hadn't the energy to so so. It was two sentences. Literally *two* – *quite* **short** – sentences. That was all that was required.  
  
On the couch that evening I told [[The-Woman]] that *I would definitely write something*. "I will write something", I said. I would write every day, no matter how inconsequential, how banale, how irritatingly vacuous you – dear reader – would find it.  

So I had to go back a few days, fill this out, and irritate you.  

It is worse for me than it is for you.
