Grandfather. Freed from any obligations and responsibilities the ability to induce neuroses in [[Human-Larvae]] is atrophied and substituted with the ability to induce gratitude mixed with guilt in the [[Paternal-Unit]], who realizes the sacrifice his – after all only human – parents did for his sake.

This guilt is only dissolved when the current [[Paternal-Unit]] transmogrifies into the [[Double-Plus-Good-Dad]] form **and** it's power is used for good in new [[Human-Larvae]]. Excess guilt is then transferred on to the succeeding [[Paternal-Unit]]. Thus the cycle continues.
