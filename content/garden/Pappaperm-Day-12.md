# Day 12 – One Single Song

I know one song. One. Single. Song.

No, wait, that is not entirely true. I – or rather, my brain – knows many, many songs. Mostly childrens songs, or theme songs from childrens television. And just the annoying parts.

And there is no off button, and it is stuck on repeat. I do not appreciate repeat.

But I do really *know* only one song: Trollmor. [[The-Baby-Son]] knows it now as well, and approximately 72 variation s of it. I am quite the lullaby jazz-improvisationalist, because, as I mentioned, I do not appreciate repeat.

I sit down to write this just after I have handed an [[incosolable bundle of joy]] to The Woman because I caught myself restarting the improvisational humming of [[The Trollmor Theme]]. 

To my self.

On repeat.

No off.
