# Day 12 â€“ Socializing
Twelve days in and I am socializing. As mentioned in [[Pappaperm-Day-03]] already, the need for adult communion has grown strong.

The pandemic had nothing on me, I was fine with the reduced social contact, but this? This! This is different. This is total isolation. So I went from zero contact last week ([[The-Woman]] excluded) to four contacts this week.
