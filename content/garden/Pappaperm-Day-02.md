## Day 02
- **0600**: Up since 0430. Baby delivered back to The Woman 0530. Everybody else at sleep. I awake. Girl woke up. Hungry. Got knekkebrød.  
- **Kindergarten delivery**.
  Addendum 2021-01-14: since I did not elaborate about the usually dreaded kindergarten delivery it must have transpired without shouting, hissing and stomping.
  This I cannot but find exceedingly unlikely, bordering on the suspicious.
- **Ate** some bread at home (no sign of PTSD, halleluja)
- Went **outside** with baby.
- Baby **woke up** after 45m.
- **11:10**:
	- **Baby** ate a bit in the kitchen.
	- **Baby** sat and complained on living room floor.  
	- **I** wish for a shower and escape from sweaty woollen underwear. **I** – in other words – also sat and complained on living room floor.
	- We're going to get along splendidly, **Baby** and **I**.
- **11:12**:
	- Baby is crawling, a relatively new development – new enough to elicit excitement in Paternal Unit (**I**) – which explains the following sequence of events:
		- My back is turned
		- I turn around
		- Now I face Baby (This was intentional, so as to observe Baby)
		- Catch Baby in the act! Excitement! It moves towards the old keyboard I gave it this morning (I cut off the cable to reduce the risk of infant-wire-induced-oxygen-deprivation-syndrome).
		- Now it's poking at it with its rubber tooth"brush". A good sign. A step closer towards a programming baby. **My chest vibrates with pride**.
- **11:29**:
	- Baby is chewing on a welcro I gave it. It discovered it's entertaining effect on my woolen underwear (which is still sweaty). RRRAAATSCH!
- **12:00**:
	- Watching documentary about SpaceX and feeding baby with store-bought glass of baby-dinner
		- First ever serving of non-mommy-home-made-made dinner, promise! Only eco-øko-organic-orgo-homemade otherwise. (Baby is as much of a hipster-snob as you; won't eat big-babyfood-produced food, will only accept home-made hippie-mom-generated organic mush)
- **12:10**:
- Baby not hungry. Trying to put him into the Babybjörn and get him to sleep. Restlessness. Doesn't calm down until I sing-hum Hava Nagila (no idea how to explain. Harry Belafonte has a version that got stuck in my head when I was 5, I'm currently looking for a therapist specializing in this particular trauma, but they are very busy)


## Prequel
**0430**:  
Up with baby → Deliver it to… put it on top of… throw it at → The Woman. Don't remember which one it was.  

She has it now; Not I.  

That is all that matters.

Now I sleep again.

Oh no! No! I do not at all fall into the sweet, sweet respite of sleep. Of course not. Because sleep matters not, not now, not to a *Middle-aged Soldier of the Second-and-a-Half-Order of Paternalhood, First Class Procrastinator, Fifteenth Level Avoider of Nappies, -7 Sleep*. Not for me. Oh no… What matters is:

**The Awoken Girl-child.**  

Her early-morning (*but-in-reality-still-black-night*)-fury is Fierce.  

I tremble in Fear.  

She is hungry. You have heard of **hangry**, but never *experienced* **tired fungry**.  

I have.  

I tremble in Fear.
