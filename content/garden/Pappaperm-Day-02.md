## Day 02
- **0600**: Up since 0430. Baby delivered back to The Woman 0530. Everybody else at sleep. I awake. Girl woke up. Hungry. Got knekkebrød.
- **Kindergarten delivery**.
Addendum 2021-01-14: since I did not elaborate about the usually dreaded kindergarten delivery it must have transpired without shouting, hissing and stomping.
This I cannot but find exceedingly unlikely bordering on the suspicious.
More probable (even than the alien abduction theory of [yesterday](Pappaperm-Day-01):
Catastrophic morning to the degree of inducing trauma in Paternal Unit → probably surpressed → sublimated → transmogrified → new neurosis cluster.
Looking forward to the flashbacks in a few years.
- **Ate** some bread at home (no sign of PTSD, halleluja)
- Went **outside** with baby.
- Baby **woke up** after 45m.
- **1110**: Baby ate a bit in the kitchen. Baby sat and complained on living room floor.
I wish for a shower and escape from sweaty woollen underwear. I – in other words – also sat and complained on living room floor.
- **1112**: Baby is crawling, a relatively new development – new enough to elicit excitement in Paternal Uni – which explains the following behaviour:
My back was turned, I turned my back. Now I faced Baby. This was intentional, so as to observe It. Caught it in the act! Excitement! It was moving towards the old keyboard I gave it this morning (I cut off the cable to reduce the risk of infant-wire-induced-oxygen-deprivation-syndrome). Now it's poking at it with its rubber tooth"brush". A good sign. A step closer towards a programming baby. My chest vibrates with pride.
- **1129**: Baby is chewing on a welcro I gave it. It discovered it's entertaining effect on my woolen underwear (which is still sweaty). RRRAAATSCH!
- **1200**: Watching documentary about SpaceX and feeding baby with store-bought glass of baby-dinner. First time. Promise. Only eco-øko-organic-orgo-homemade otherwise. (Baby is as much of a hipster-snob as you; won't eat big-babyfood-produced food, will only accept home-made hippie-mom-generated organic mush)
- **1210**: Not hungry. Trying to put him into the Babybjörn and get him to sleep. Restlessness. Doesn't calm down until I sing-hum Hava Nagila (no idea how to explain. Harry Belafonte has a version that got stuck in my head when I was 5)


## Prequel
**0430**: Up with baby → Deliver it to… put it on top of… throw it at → The Woman. Don't remember which one it was.  

She has it now; Not I.  

That is all that matters.
  
Now I sleep again.

Oh no! No! I do not at all fall into the sweet, swett respite of sleep. Sleep matters not, not now, not for me. What matters is:

The Awoken Girl-child.  
  
Her early-morning (*but-in-reality-still-black-night*)-fury is **F**ierce.  

I tremble in **F**ear.  
  
She is hungry. You have heard of **hangry**, but never *experienced* **tired fungry**.  

I have.  

I tremble in Fear.
