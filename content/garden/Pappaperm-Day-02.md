# Day 02

## 06:00
- Up since 0430. Baby delivered back to The Woman 0530. Everybody else at sleep. I awake. Girl woke up. Hungry. Got knekkebrød.  
- **Kindergarten delivery**.  
 Addendum 2021-01-14: since I did not elaborate about the usually dreaded kindergarten delivery it must have transpired without shouting, hissing and stomping.
  This I cannot but find exceedingly unlikely, bordering on the suspicious.

## 11:10
**Baby** ate a bit in the kitchen.  
**Baby** sat and complained on living room floor.  
**I** wish for a shower and escape from sweaty woollen underwear. **I** – in other words – also sat and complained on living room floor.  
We're going to get along splendidly, **Baby** and **I**.  

## 01:12
[[The-Baby-Son]] is crawling, a relatively new development – new enough to elicit excitement in [[Paternal Unit]]
It moves towards the old keyboard I gave it this morning (I cut off the cable – yes, *that* old – for safety).  
Now it's poking at it with its rubber tooth"brush". A good sign. A step closer towards a programming baby. **My chest vibrates with pride**.
## 11:29
Baby is chewing on a welcro I gave it. It discovered it's entertaining effect on my woolen underwear (which is still sweaty). RRRAAATSCH!
## 12:00
Watching documentary about SpaceX and feeding baby with store-bought glass of baby-dinner.  
First ever serving of non-mommy-home-made-made dinner, promise! Only eco-øko-organic-orgo-homemade otherwise. (Baby is as much of a hipster-snob as you; won't eat big-babyfood-produced food, will only accept home-made hippie-mom-generated organic food)

## 12:10
Baby not hungry. Trying to put him into the Babybjörn and get him to sleep. Restlessness. Doesn't calm down until I sing-hum Hava Nagila (no idea how to explain. Harry Belafonte has a version that got stuck in my head when I was 5, I'm currently looking for a therapist specializing in this particular trauma, but they are very busy)


## Prequel
### 04:30
Up with baby → Deliver it to… put it on top of… throw it at → The Woman. Don't remember which one it was.  

She has it now; Not I.  

That is all that matters.

Now I sleep again.

Oh no! No! I do not at all fall into the sweet, sweet respite of sleep. Of course not. Because sleep matters not, not now, not to a *Middle-aged Soldier of the Second-and-a-Half-Order of Paternalhood, First Class Procrastinator, Fifteenth Level Avoider of Nappies, class: Grizzled Cynic, religion: Resentful Stoicism, gender: solipsist, -7 Sleep, Holder of the Encryption Key of Roko's Basilisk*. Not for me. Oh no… What matters is:

**The Awoken Girl-child.**  
*aka [Fury-Girl](Fury-Girl.md)*

Her early-morning (*but-in-reality-still-black-night*)-**fury** is Fierce.  

I tremble in Fear.  

She is hungry. You have heard of **hangry**, but she is **Fu**ng**ry**.

I bet you have never *experienced* **tired fungry**.  

I have.  

I – a Middle-aged Soldier fo the Second-and-a-Half-Order of Paternalhood… I tremble.

I tremble in Fear.
