# Day 14 – Sweet, Sweet Respite
*2021-01-22, Friday*

Today I got rid of that baby.  

And his sister.  

And [[The Woman]] left me.

Solitude. Blissful solitude.

I also notice that I have acclimatized to Norway now. It took me a few years after moving back here from Berlin, but now I am in no doubt as to when I can no longer get beer at the store.

Now I know – viscerally – that after eight this night, I won't be able to *properly* enjoy my night alone.
